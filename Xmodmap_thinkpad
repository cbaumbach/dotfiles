! Key bindings suitable for ThinkPad X220 laptop
! with optional external IBM Model M keyboard.
!
! To use these key bindings, run the following at startup:
!
! /bin/bash -c "sleep 15; xmodmap $HOME/dotfiles/Xmodmap_thinkpad"

clear Control
clear Mod1
clear Mod4
clear Mod5

! Alt_L to Control_L
keycode 64 = Control_L

! Alt_R to Control_R
keycode 108 = Control_R

! Super_L to Alt_L
keycode 133 = Alt_L

! Menu to Alt_R
keycode 135 = Alt_R

! Control_L to Alt_L
keycode 37 = Alt_L

! Control_R to Alt_R
keycode 105 = Alt_R

! If we did not have to support an external IBM Model M keyboard,
! we would map the Control keys to Super and Hyper:
!
! Control_L to Super_L
! keycode 37 = Super_L
!
! Control_R to Hyper_R
! keycode 105 = Hyper_R

add Control = Control_L Control_R
add Mod1    = Alt_L Alt_R
add Mod4    = Super_L
add Mod5    = Hyper_R
