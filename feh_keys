# An example key configuration file can be found at
# /usr/share/doc/feh/examples/keys.
#
# Comments start with a # sign, do not use them mid-line.
# Each line must be blank, a comment, or a key definition.
#
# key definition: <action name> <key1> [<key2> [<key3>]]
#
# Each <key> is an X11 keysym (as output by xev) with optional
# modifier.  For instance, C-x would be Ctrl+X, or 4-space Mod4+Space.
# A list of X11 keysyms can be found in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h.
# You only have to drop the "XK_" prefixes.
#
# If you want to unbind certain commands, mention the command by
# itself without binding a key to it.
